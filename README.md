# The-Illusion-of-Multitasking-An-OS-Perspective
A simple C program that demonstrates how operating systems create the illusion of multitasking using CPU scheduling.
The project simulates FCFS scheduling and shows that only one process runs at a time through context switching.
It highlights how scheduling, not parallelism, enables multitasking.
